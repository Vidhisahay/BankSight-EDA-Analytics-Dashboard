# BankSight: Banking Data Analytics and Dashboard

## Executive Summary
Banksight analyzed 3,000 high-net-worth retail banking customers and found that 44% in the entry-level Jade tier hold the highest deposits ($697K), surpassing even Platinum clients—posing a $12M annual revenue risk from potential churn. To address this, the Deposit Loyalty Accelerator (DLA) program targets Jade customers with fee waivers and yield incentives, projected to lift retention by 12%, grow deposits by 8%, and deliver a 3:1 ROI in a year. An interactive Power BI dashboard visualizes these insights, helping executives track loyalty health and act on real-time data alerts.

##Business Problem
The main challenge is a 15–20% yearly churn among Jade-tier customers, who hold 44% of total deposits but cause major balance fluctuations. In 2025, U.S. banks are facing intense competition from digital-first players like Chime and Ally, driving over $50B in deposit shifts each year. The dataset reflects this trend — Jade customers maintain higher deposits (~$697K, 5% above Silver/Gold) but have shorter tenures (7–10 years), showing strong acquisition but weak retention. This churn translates to $2K–$3K in lost annual revenue per customer, or about $12M across 500 clients. While risk remains steady (avg. 2.26), 30% of lending capacity stays unused, and with deposits declining 1.1% in early 2025, banks could face a 5–8% portfolio shrinkage by 2026 if retention strategies aren’t strengthened.

## Business Recommendation: Deposit Loyalty Accelerator Program
To address retention gaps, deploy a tiered upgrade initiative leveraging data signals like high Jade deposits and fee tolerance. Core Components are:

- Targeting: Segment 1,000 Jade clients with >$500K deposits (33% of tier); prioritize High-fee Europeans (48% overlap). 
- Incentives: 6-month fee rebate (up to $200) for Silver upgrade; 2% APY bonus on linked deposits for Gold. 
- Implementation: Digital nudge via app/email, A/B test vs. control group.
- Metrics & ROI: Track retention (+12% target), deposit growth (+8%), churn reduction.
